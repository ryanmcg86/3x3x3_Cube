Thesis Project

Program Name: ThreeByThreeCube

Purpose of this Program: The purpose of this program is to systematically
	go through every possible case a 3x3x3 Rubik's cube can exist in,
  in order to be able to say the following:
    "When there are x moves performed on a 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube, 
    there are ____ cases that take y moves to solve."
  A chart that will display the results is set up with incrementing x values
  in each column, incrementing y values for each row, and the blank will be
  filled in with the correct value to appropriately complete the statement.
